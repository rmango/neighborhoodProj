        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>The Seattle International District is a neighborhood with a rich and tumultuous history. Its predominantly Asian American community has faced much discrimination through both legislation and violence from other groups. Through adversity, Seattle’s International District has grown into a vibrant cultural center for many different Asian cultures. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="obs">
        <h1>Observations</h1>
        <p>When I visited the community, it was a first-timer for me. I was baffled by the dedicated representation of culture in the area. The first thing that caught my attention was the Arch that was around the train station. The shops all around were also Asian-themed restaurants, mainly Chinese but other Japanese and Vietnamese restaurants were present. What my group and I observed in the community was very similar to what we had read about the area before we visited. The area in Chinatown felt like a misplaced piece of land right out of China, which caught us by surprise because we just expected an average ethnic area, but we were stunned with the amount of cultural representation in that area.</p>

    <div id="history">
        <h1>Local History</h1>
        <p>Throughout the history of Seattle’s International District, Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans have faced much discrimination, but have still built a vibrant community. </p>
        <p>Chinese first immigrated to Seattle in the 1860s, mostly doing hard labor, domestic jobs, and working on the railroads. But in the 1880s, many Chinese were violently forced out of the area by racist white settlers who were angered by an economic depression. Soon after, Japanese immigrants arrived, filling the jobs left empty by Chinese. Chinese and Japanese immigrants lived and worked alongside Native Americans and African Americans in this diverse community.  </p>
        <p>The International District continued to grow in prosperity and population, with more immigrants coming from China, Japan, and the Philippines. This growth was hampered, however, by racist laws and regulations. In 1941, Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor stirred up much anti-Japanese sentiment. In 1942, Roosevelt signed Executive Order #9066, paving the way for Japanese internment. American citizens of Japanese descent as well as Japanese immigrants were sent to internment camps. Those in Seattle were sent to either Camp Harmony near Puyallup or sent to Idaho. Faculty and students at the University of Washington fought to prevent the internment but were not successful. After the war, many did not return to Seattle. </p>
        <p>Despite adversity, the community has grown. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, there was an influx of Vietnamese and Southeast Asian immigrants, adding to the diverse mix of cultures in the International district. The neighborhood will continue to grow and be shaped by different cultures now and in the future. </p>

        <h1 id="minority">Ethnic Minority</h1>
        <p>Seattle’s Chinatown has come from a very complex background. It first started up as the place where the African-Americans, Vietnamese and Southeast Asians lived. Then after the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in 1886, riots and violence fumed up that resulted in forcing many Chinese residents out of Seattle. The many families resided in the International District, where their population began to cluster and increase that caused the area to be dominated with the Chinese culture which gave a rise to Chinatown.</p>
        <img src="img\people.png" style="float:left;padding:3em;">
        <p>The Japanese Internment also played a big role in shaping the culture around the international district, since many Japanese families were forced to relocate to the International District during the 2nd World War. The population of the Japanese was initially very minute, but after they also formed clusters, that formed what we know today as Japantown, many Japanese families and other Asian families were attracted to the area. </p>
        <p>Afterwards, by 30 years from the 2nd World War, City officials proclaimed the neighborhood with the name “International District” due to the many different ethnicities present in the area, even though it is predominated by the Chinese.</p>
        <p>The population health in the area started out extremely bad. People were forced into the area due to riots and internments, but after long fought battles the area succeeded economically and gave a rise to a new powerful generation. Up to this day, this area attracts many visitors due to the close representation of the culture of the people living within. People back in 1886 were very poor, had no jobs and couldn’t have a consistent income, but after the help of the government, the people within and the rise of the newer generation, the area stood up on its feet and almost all the families in the area have a good income and secure health and life statuses.</p>

        <h1>Geography</h1>
        <p>The geography of the International District is fairly basic. It is one of the few parts of Seattle where the majority of the region is on an even gradient. The International District is an area consisting of four separate borders. Just outside three of those borders there are three large hills. On one border there is Capitol Hill, on another border there is the Pacific Tower which looms over the whole district and on the other side of the last border, Rainier Ave, there is First Hill.<img src="img\map1.png" style="float:left;padding:2em;width:30%;"> The fourth border of the District is where Safeco and Centurylink field are located and that border is level with the International District. What this ends up creating is one level concrete district that does not have a lot of interesting geography going on with it. There are different parks and interesting buildings throughout the concrete grid but it is essentially a bowl surrounded by large hills on three sides. There are organizations out there such as Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority (SCIDpda) who are looking to push the International District’s economic, environmental and urban planning capacity forward. They utilize group projects and the idea space which they have created at their facility to bring the community together and push the district forward. The organization manages 500 units of affordable housing and 200,000 square feet of retail space. In a geographic location as urban as the International District affordable housing and quality retail space are key to the economic health of the area. The organization's main focus with their group projects is business assistance, community design, neighborhood safety and real estate development. SCIDpda is an amazing organization looking to better the economic and environmental health of its community along with better urban planning and real estate development.</p>

        <h1>Demographics</h1>
        <p>The international district is composed of a primarily Asian residents, sitting at a 47.5% Asian population in the area. The second primary group is Caucasians at 27.7%, followed by Black at 12.1%, Mixed at 5.5%, Hispanic at 4.6%, and Other at 2.6%. Racially, the International District has a 33.4% increase in Asian residents compared to the majority of Seattle’s residents.</p>
        <img src="img\demographics1.png">
        <p>As for the age of the International District’s residents, the highest percentage of them are between the ages of 55-64 with the next highest age group being 35-44. This means that, on average, the residents of the International District skew towards middle aged to elderly on average. </p>
        <img src="img\demographics2.png">
        <p>Because the population itself leans towards the older side, this means that the residents are at a higher risk for disease or injury since age naturally comes with more need for medical assistance. In general, since the majority of residents are older, those residents have a higher risk of cardiovascular issues and disease simply due to their age, which makes the overall population health of the area lower.</p>
