    <h1>Geography</h1>
        <p>The geography of the International District is fairly basic. It is one of the few parts of Seattle where the majority of the region is on an even gradient. The International District is an area consisting of four separate borders. Just outside three of those borders there are three large hills. On one border there is Capitol Hill, on another border there is the Pacific Tower which looms over the whole district and on the other side of the last border, Rainier Ave, there is First Hill. The fourth border of the District is where Safeco and Centurylink field are located and that border is level with the International District. What this ends up creating is one level concrete district that does not have a lot of interesting geography going on with it. There are different parks and interesting buildings throughout the concrete grid but it is essentially a bowl surrounded by large hills on three sides. There are organizations out there such as Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority (SCIDpda) who are looking to push the International District’s economic, environmental and urban planning capacity forward. They utilize group projects and the idea space which they have created at their facility to bring the community together and push the district forward. The organization manages 500 units of affordable housing and 200,000 square feet of retail space. In a geographic location as urban as the International District affordable housing and quality retail space are key to the economic health of the area. The organization's main focus with their group projects is business assistance, community design, neighborhood safety and real estate development. SCIDpda is an amazing organization looking to better the economic and environmental health of its community along with better urban planning and real estate development.</p>
